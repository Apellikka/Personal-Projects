# Personal-Projects JAVA

My own personal projects that I've made as a hobby and for fun.

To-do list volume 1 is a to do list application that works exclusively in console. Saves and loads to a file and has login for distinct users.

To-do list volume 2 is a to do list application that works in console and also has a GUI. Saves and loads to MySQL-database. Single user application.

WorkoutApp is a weightlifting training log app in progress. It will work on android and I am currently coding it in Android Studio.
